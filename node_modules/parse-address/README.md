# US Street Address Parser  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hassansin/parse-address.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hassansin/parse-address)

This is Node.js port for Perl [Geo::StreetAddress::US](http://search.cpan.org/~timb/Geo-StreetAddress-US-1.04/US.pm) package

*Description from Geo::StreetAddress::US*:

>Geo::StreetAddress::US is a regex-based street address and street intersection parser for the United States. Its basic goal is to be as forgiving as possible when parsing user-provided address strings. Geo::StreetAddress::US knows about directional prefixes and suffixes, fractional building numbers, building units, grid-based addresses (such as those used in parts of Utah), 5 and 9 digit ZIP codes, and all of the official USPS abbreviations for street types and state names...

## Usage:

//from node:
npm install parse-address
var parser = require('parse-address'); 
var parsed = parser.parseLocation('1005 N Gravenstein Highway Sebastopol CA 95472');

//from browser:
<script type="text/javascript" src="./parse-address.min.js"></script>
var parsed = parseAddress.parseLocation('1005 N Gravenstein Highway Sebastopol CA 95472');
